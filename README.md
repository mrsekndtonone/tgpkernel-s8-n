Compiled using my own built custom toolchain

* URL: https://github.com/djb77/aarch64-cortex_a53-linux-gnueabi

## How to use
Adjust the toolchain path in build.sh and Makefile to match the path on your system. 

Run build.sh with the following options, doesn't matter what order keep and silent are in.

- **./build.sh** will build TGPKernel
- **./build.sh keep** will build TGPKernel and also copy the .img files to the output folder
- **./build.sh silent** will build TGPKernel but only display warning and errors in the log
- **./build.sh 0** will clear the workspace
- **./build.sh 00** will clear CCACHE

When finished, the new files and logs will be created in the output directory.

If Java is installed, the .zip file will be signed.
